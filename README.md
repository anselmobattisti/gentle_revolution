# Gentle Revolution

Glenn Doman's Gentle Revolution is an innovative approach to education and child development, conceived by Glenn Doman, founder of the Institutes for the Development of Human Potential. This methodology, developed in the second half of the 20th century, is based on the belief that children have an innate and impressive capacity to learn, especially in the first years of life. Doman argued that by providing appropriate educational stimuli, parents and educators can significantly accelerate and improve children's cognitive and physical development.

His approach includes techniques such as early presentation of information in the form of flashcards, mobility exercises and early reading programs. Unlike traditional educational methods, which often begin at school age, Doman's Gentle Revolution emphasizes the importance of learning from birth to age six, a period he considered crucial for brain development.

Although his ideas were initially controversial and differed from many conventional educational paradigms, they gained a considerable following and influenced many modern educational practices, especially in the field of early education.
